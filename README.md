# SampleTest

This repository includes a simple 3D browser game built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The game now features three difficulty levels, a score counter and the ability to pause the action with the `P` key.

## Run the game
Open `index.html` in a modern browser like Chrome. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the green cube and avoid the red obstacles.
Keep an eye on the HUD in the top right for your current level and score.
